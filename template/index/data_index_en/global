presentation:
'''<p>
Since September 2025 I am a postdoc at the MPI-MiS in Leipzig, in Anna Wienhard's group. 
</p>
<p>
Before that, I was PhD student in mathematics, supervised by Bertrand Deroin, 
then a postdoc at the IRMAR in Rennes, working with Serge Cantat and Christophe Dupont. 
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in geometrical and dynamical aspects of groups.  
In particular, I study spaces of deformations of subgroups of linear groups, using techniques from complex dynamics.  
</p>
